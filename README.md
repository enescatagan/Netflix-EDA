# Netflix-EDA
#### Exploratory Data Analysis with using kaggle's 'Netflix Movies and TV Shows' Data Set.

In this notebook;
* We will unveil;
  * the distribution of genres, 
  * the distribution of countries, 
  * the distribution of countries, and
  * the distribution of duration
* We will see yearly and monthly contents and how many are those.
* We will understand insides of contents by examining content description using WordCloud

For visualizations I used; seaborn, pyplot, plotly, wordCloud and missingno. Some of the visuals interactive, and some of it static. But there's a lot improve. Feedbacks are welcome.
